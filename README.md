# Gusto Lunch Menu

## The Problem

At Gusto, we really enjoy our catered lunches. We use a rotating schedule for the lunch menu, but it has been tricky for us to keep track of it. To help us plan our week, we'd like an app that displays the lunch schedule on a calendar. You'll find the raw lunch schedule data below.

### Rotating Lunch Schedule

* Week 1
  * Monday - Chicken and waffles
  * Tuesday - Tacos
  * Wednesday - Curry
  * Thursday - Pizza
  * Friday - Sushi
* Week 2
  * Monday - Breakfast for lunch
  * Tuesday - Hamburgers
  * Wednesday - Spaghetti
  * Thursday - Salmon
  * Friday - Sandwiches
